D) Both do exactly the same thing

#15. In Qiskit v2.x, which statement is most accurate?

A) Only V1 primitives exist
B) V2 primitives (BaseSamplerV2, BaseEstimatorV2) are the current interfaces; older V1 interfaces are deprecated
C) Primitives were removed entirely
D) Primitives only work on hardware, not simulators

#16. What is BackendSamplerV2 mainly used for?

A) Wrapping a BackendV2 so it can be used through the SamplerV2 interface
B) Drawing circuits
C) Importing OpenQASM 3
D) Building a Target from scratch

#17. Calling StatevectorEstimator.run(...) returns:

A) A matplotlib figure
B) A primitive job object; you retrieve the result via .result()
C) A dict of counts directly
D) A QuantumCircuit

#18. A Sampler is designed to return:

A) Samples from classical output registers (bitstrings), possibly as quasi-probabilities depending on implementation
B) Only a unitary matrix
C) Only a density matrix
D) Only expectation values of Paulis

#19. To estimate ⟨Z⊗Z⟩ for a circuit with two qubits, Estimator conceptually needs:

C) qiskit.qasm2.dumps() only
D) QuantumCircuit.to_qasm3() only

#21. Which statement is most accurate about parsing OpenQASM 3 into a QuantumCircuit?

A) qiskit.qasm3.loads() works out-of-the-box for all OpenQASM 3 programs with no extra components
B) Import support can require the qiskit-qasm3-import extension, and feature support is evolving
C) Qiskit cannot export OpenQASM 3 at all
D) OpenQASM 3 is only for visualization

#22. When is transpilation typically necessary?

A) Always, even for pure statevector reference primitives
B) Typically when targeting a specific backend (hardware or backend-based execution) with constraints
C) Only when using OpenQASM 2
